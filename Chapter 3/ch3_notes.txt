Big O Notation
- used to express the efficiency of an algorithm
- essential question: if there are N data elements, how many steps will an algorithm take?

Bubble Sort
- basic sorting algorithm to sort unordered arrays into ascending order
- uses a loop to pass through the array
- compares two sequential values in an array to determine which is smaller
- moves each smaller value to the left
- must loop through array until all values have been swapped into the correct order
- loop runs until no swaps are made during the pass through

Bubble Sort Efficiency
- Steps:
    - comparisons
        - for N elements, (N -1) + (N - 2) + (N - 3)... + 1 comparisons
    - swaps
        - as the number of elements increases, the number of swaps increases exponentially
- Big O = O(N**2)
- O(N**2) = quadratic time
