Q1 - Replace the question marks in the following table to describe how many steps occur
for a given number of data elements across various types of Big O.

N elements          O(N)    O(logN)     O(N^2)
100                 100        ?           ? 
2000                 ?         ?           ?

Answer:

N elements          O(N)    O(logN)     O(N^2)
100                 100      ~6-7       10,000 
2000                2000     ~11        4,000,000

Q2 - If we have an O(N^2) algorithm that processes an array and find that it takes 256 
steps, what is the size of the array?

Answer: the square root of 256, or 16 elements
